											<h4>Introduction</h4>
							<p class="pb-3 mb-4">Earthquakes are one of the natural phenomena that affect humans and their property. 
								Since it is difficult to prevent the occurrence of this natural phenomenon, 
								we have to live with it. Therefore, it is necessary to understand the causes of their occurrence,
								how to deal with them, and the extent to which their risks can be reduced.
								All countries that are characterized by seismic activity seek to Big or weak, 
								to establish extensive networks for seismic monitoring, and do not wait for the disaster to occur, 
								especially after the Southeast Asian earthquake and the accompanying heavy losses due to the tsunami phenomenon 
								that accompanied its occurrence.
								Every year, the world faces many natural hazards that cause multiple humanitarian disasters that lead to massive 
								losses in property and human lives. Earthquakes constitute the most dangerous of these disasters 
								because of the destruction they result due to the element of surprise they cause when they occur. 
								It is known that the most violent types of earthquakes that Humanity is affected by kinetic (sliding) 
								earthquakes that are concentrated around the edges of the plates (plates) that make up the Earth’s crust. 
								In addition, the movements of volcanic magma cause weak to moderate vibrational movements that may lead to some limited losses, 
								in addition to what can be caused by eruptions and volcanic ejections of various kinds. Destruction of everything it finds 
								in its path or falls within its sphere of influence.
							
							</p>
							<h4>Types of earthquakes:</h4>
							<p>Earthquakes are divided according to the nature of their occurrence into two main categories:</p>
							<h5>1-Natural earthquakes</h5>
							<p>Natural earthquakes are classified into kinetic and volcanic, 
								as earthquakes occur in known places on the Earth’s surface, 
								known as seismic belts or seismic zones. These are places that have special geological characteristics 
								and are characterized by the weakness of the Earth’s crust, its lack of thickness, and the abundance of faults and faults in it. 
								These earthquakes arise as a result of the relative movements of the plates that make up the Earth’s surface. 
								Where internal stresses accumulate in rocks located at the boundaries of moving plates,
								The deformations resulting from bending, tension, and pressure, 
								as well as frictional forces across the surfaces separating the kinetic (tectonic) plates, 
								contribute to a significant increase in the accumulated stresses until they exceed the maximum stress 
								values ​​to bear the rocks, which leads to rupture and sudden movement of the rocks to displace them to 
								new places of equilibrium, and the stored energy is released. In the form of seismic waves.
								As for volcanic earthquakes, they occur as a result of the movement of magma under the Earth’s surface and the release of seismic waves. 
								The strength of these earthquakes is rarely large and destructive.
							</p>
							<h5>2-Industrial earthquakes</h5>
							<p>They are impactful seismic waves resulting from some human activities, 
								such as industrial and nuclear explosions, the construction of giant dams, 
								the formation of artificial lakes, the withdrawal of water and oil, and others.
								Earthquakes of all kinds are among the most important dangers that affect humans 
								and the environment surrounding them. Their risks lie in the vibration of the Earth’s surface, 
								which leads to the collapse of the rocky mantle and the complete or partial collapse of the structures 
								based on it. More than a million earthquakes of varying strength occur annually on the surface 
								of the Earth, and humans only feel about a third of them.
							</p>
							<h4>Earthquakes measurement:</h4>
							<p>Earthquakes are measured according to their magnitude and intensity. 
								The power is measured by measuring the energy released from the epicenter of the earthquake in 
								the form of seismic kinetic waves. The seismic power is expressed on the Richter scale and measured 
								by mathematical relations, while the intensity of the earthquake and the amount of destruction 
								resulting from it is measured through several scales, the most important of which is the scale 
								( Mercali), if the tremor is weak, it is not felt by people, but is only monitored by devices, 
								and if the tremor is strong, people feel it, and it may cause damage and destruction depending on 
								the magnitude of the tremor, the proximity of the area to the epicenter of the tremor, the geology 
								of the area, in addition to its depth (close to the surface of the earth or deep).
							</p>
							<h4>Effects of earthquakes:</h4>
							<ol>
								<li>Subsidence or elevation of some areas of the Earth's surface, such as the appearance or submergence of some islands and coasts.</li>
								<li>Collapses and landslides, especially at the foothills of highlands and in areas where there are caves and gaps under the surface of the ground, leading to the destruction of buildings, roads, etc.</li>
								<li>Ground cracks and the resulting damage caused by earthquakes affect buildings in those areas, requiring the use of an earthquake-resistant building system.</li>
								<li>Soil liquefaction leads to the collapse of structures built on it</li>
								<li>Tsunami waves cause large areas adjacent to the coast to be submerged with water</li>
								<li>Fires due to damage to electricity, gas and others</li>
							</ol>

											<h4>Hisrtorical Earthquake</h4>
											<p>Historical sources reported that, at the very least, 
												over the past thousand years, earthquakes occurred that were felt by people within the borders of the Kingdom 
												of Saudi Arabia, and the locations of their occurrence were known very roughly due to the decline in population and 
												lack of records in the past. Current statistics indicate that historical records on seismic activity are largely incomplete, 
												even for earthquakes of magnitude 6 or greater. A well-documented event is the occurrence of a volcanic eruption or 
												lava flow in Harrat Rahat near Medina in the year 654 AH (1256 AD), which was accompanied by noticeable seismic activity, 
												and this region still witnesses low seismic activity until now. It is known that the last important seismic event was 
												the “Haql” earthquake that occurred in 1995 AD in the Gulf of Aqaba (with a magnitude of 7.3 seismic moment), resulting in 
												major damage that affected the cities on both sides of the Gulf of Aqaba, and was felt by people hundreds of kilometers away. 
												Also, earthquakes with a magnitude of 6 that occur along the Red Sea axis are not felt by the people of the cities located 
												on both sides of the Red Sea, but they may pose a tangible danger to the infrastructure.
											</p>
											<br>
											<p>
												More recently, a moderate earthquake with a magnitude of 5.4 occurred in 2009 in Harrat al-Shaqah (Lunier), north of the city of Yanbu, 
												linked to the activity of the magmatic body deep in the shallow earth’s crust. Although only minor property damage occurred, 
												it indicates To the possibility of some risks associated with earthquakes in the Arabian Shield.

											<h4>Automated Earthquakes Recoverment</h4>
											<p>
												The US Geological Survey uses the Hydra seismic analysis software package to automatically determine the location and strength of an earthquake. 
												This program identifies and captures the arrival of seismic waves automatically, 
												although this can be done manually if necessary. The time and location of the earthquake are then determined, 
												within a few minutes of receiving the data. This program saves the last 500 seismic events. They are projected onto the map, 
												as shown below, and by clicking on any event, a control window is displayed that allows more detail of the earthquake parameters.

The table shows the percentage of errors in the arrival times of the waves relative to the expected arrival times recorded at seismic monitoring stations, which shows the errors in the times recorded during the monitoring process. This error sometimes occurs due to the weak arrival of seismic waves with low amplitude of the primary waves, especially since there is apparent noise in the recording.
